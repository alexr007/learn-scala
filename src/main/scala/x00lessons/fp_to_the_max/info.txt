that code from the video 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxudIMiOo68

problems:
- partial functions
- exceptions 
- variable scope ! 

1. total. for every input we always have an output 
2. deterministic. for the same input the same output 
3. pure. there is no effect allowed inside the functions 

IDEA: to represent any interaction with world in some manner
