I'm impressed how you were able to keep moderate learning curve and made it steep enough
very close to the end of the book

- we write code not for computers and compilers.
- we write the code for humans, for us, tomorrow.
- it's easy to write spaghetti code, its's hard to write good readable code.

- p31 - VISIBLE, ACCESSIBLE, NESTED ?
but the second part of that sentence seems okay to me
cool explanation

+ good that you started from visibility in the beginning

very cool that you provide the tasks to involve reader into investigations and further reading
- p32
  don't you want to
  explain that `undefined` means `nothing` in terms of assignment operation?
  put scheme of memory model variable/reference/memory/heap/stack
    probably, it will be easier further
    (Yes, in Scala we don't have primitives)
  And I have found it easier to teach about JMM on the lesson 5 out of 50

- p33
  When you buy a car, it has either two pedals or three one =>
  - When you buy a car, it has either two pedals or three
  - When you buy a car, it has either two pedals or three ones

- p38
  very cool, that you have explained that all operators are shortcut for object methods

- p39
  missed closing diamond bracket

- p42
  typo

- p43
  according to the declaration on p42 function vault has 2 arguments: storage and entrance
  but in the code snippet on p.43 you have passed only one, and it is an entrance (2nd)
  where is the 1st one (storage)

- 54 cool that you have introduced testing in so early stage
- 55 mocking very cool explanation
- 56 dependency injection!
- 61 build
